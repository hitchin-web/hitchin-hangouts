This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You will need 3 terminals...

The first to run the database and Adminer:

```bash
docker-compose up # Creates a PostgreSQL database and Adminer
```

The second to run commands:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local # Set configuration variables
yarn install               # Install dependencies into node_modules
yarn run migrate           # Run database migrations & generate types
yarn run seed              # Add seed information to database
```

And finally, a third to run the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev                   # Start the server
```

In your browser:

 * Open [http://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080) to access Adminer.
 * Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
